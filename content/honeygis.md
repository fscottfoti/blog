[HoneyGIS](http://github.com/fscottfoti/honeygis) is mainly added here for completeness as it was one of the first web prototypes I built.  It takes a csv of point data and aggregates it into a themed honeycomb map.  Options include quantile/equal interval theming, color scheme, size of the honeycomb and the aggregation type.  It's super simple as it's only a couple hundred lines of HTML/Javascript, but most of my later apps are derived from this set of basic functionality.
