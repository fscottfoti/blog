Title: About

This is the blog for Fletcher Foti.  I work as an urban modeler and open source coder as the firm Oakland Analytics.  I also have a partnership with Ian Carlton as the firm [MapCraft](http://mapcraft.io).

As a solo artist I mostly works on the regional forecast for the San Francisco Bay Area, and when I'm working with Ian we build the propritary software called MapCraft Labs.

This is probably the best place to learn about my open source and consulting projects which might be useful to you or your organization and feel free to reach out to me on Twitter.
