**Kepler-186f** is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Kepler-186,
about 490 light-years (151 pc) from the Earth. It is the first planet
with a radius similar to Earth's to be discovered in the habitable zone of
another star. NASA's Kepler spacecraft detected it using the transit
method, along with four additional planets orbiting much closer to the star
(all modestly larger than Earth). Analysis of three years of data was
required to find its signal. The results were presented initially at a
conference on 19 March 2014 and some details were reported in the media
at the time.[10] The full public announcement was on 17 April 2014,
followed by publication in Science.[1]
