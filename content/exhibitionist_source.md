SubTitle: Coining a term to mean a project that is developed in public on GitHub

I think exhibitionist source should be a thing.  I’ve seen too many projects which were claimed to be open source but which only gave the source code to clients when they asked (and even then, only with extensive prodding), or that develop in private and push releases to github.  Alternatively, there are others who air all their dirty laundry on github, including design discussions and bugs, and generally use the tool like the coder’s Facebook.  I think we should call this exhibitionist source, and obviously I’m for it.
